/// # CPI Reentrancy Attacker Program
/// 
/// This program demonstrates how a malicious external program can exploit reentrancy 
/// vulnerabilities in Solana programs that use Cross-Program Invocations (CPI).
/// 
/// ## The Reentrancy Attack Pattern
/// 
/// In a reentrancy attack on Solana:
/// 1. Victim program reads state (e.g., `balance = 1000`)
/// 2. Victim program calls external program via CPI (this attacker program)
/// 3. **During the CPI, the attacker gains control of execution**
/// 4. Attacker can:
///    - Inspect victim's account state
///    - Construct a recursive CPI back to the victim
///    - Trigger additional withdrawals while victim's state is stale
/// 5. Control returns to victim program
/// 6. Victim program updates state based on OLD values from step 1
/// 7. **Result: State corruption and fund drainage**
/// 
/// ## Why This Works (Vulnerable Pattern)
/// 
/// ```rust
/// // VULNERABLE: Read → CPI → Update
/// pub fn unsafe_withdraw(ctx: Context<Withdraw>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
///     let old_balance = ctx.accounts.vault.balance;  // STEP 1: Read
///     
///     // STEP 2: External call - ATTACKER GAINS CONTROL HERE
///     cpi::notify_external_program(&ctx.accounts.notifier)?;
///     
///     // STEP 3: Update with stale data - TOO LATE!
///     ctx.accounts.vault.balance = old_balance.saturating_sub(amount);
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## How the Attack Exploits This
/// 
/// **Transaction Timeline:**
/// - T0: User calls `unsafe_withdraw(100)`
/// - T1: Victim reads `balance = 1000`
/// - T2: Victim calls attacker's `reentrancy_hook` via CPI
/// - **T3: ATTACKER EXECUTES (this program runs)**
/// - T4: Attacker inspects victim vault: `balance = 1000` (unchanged)
/// - T5: Attacker constructs CPI back to victim: `unsafe_withdraw(500)`
/// - T6: Victim (inner call) reads `balance = 1000` (still stale!)
/// - T7: Victim (inner call) writes `balance = 500`
/// - T8: Control returns to attacker
/// - T9: Attacker completes `reentrancy_hook`
/// - **T10: Control returns to original `unsafe_withdraw(100)`**
/// - T11: Victim writes `balance = 900` (using T1's stale value)
/// - **RESULT: Withdrew 600 total, but balance only decreased by 100**
/// 
/// ## Defense Mechanisms (How to Prevent This)
/// 
/// The fix requires TWO changes:
/// 
/// 1. **CEI Pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions):**
///    ```rust
///    // SECURE: Check → Update → CPI
///    pub fn safe_withdraw(ctx: Context<Withdraw>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
///        // CHECKS: Validate inputs
///        require!(amount <= ctx.accounts.vault.balance, ErrorCode::InsufficientBalance);
///        
///        // EFFECTS: Update state BEFORE external call
///        ctx.accounts.vault.balance = ctx.accounts.vault.balance.checked_sub(amount)?;
///        
///        // INTERACTIONS: External call happens last
///        cpi::notify_external_program(&ctx.accounts.notifier)?;
///        Ok(())
///    }
///    ```
/// 
/// 2. **Reentrancy Guard (Lock Flag):**
///    ```rust
///    #[account]
///    pub struct Vault {
///        pub balance: u64,
///        pub locked: bool,  // Prevents recursive calls
///    }
///    
///    pub fn safe_withdraw(ctx: Context<Withdraw>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
///        // Check lock
///        require!(!ctx.accounts.vault.locked, ErrorCode::Locked);
///        
///        // Set lock
///        ctx.accounts.vault.locked = true;
///        
///        // Update balance
///        ctx.accounts.vault.balance = ctx.accounts.vault.balance.checked_sub(amount)?;
///        
///        // External call (if attacker tries to re-enter, lock check fails)
///        cpi::notify_external_program(&ctx.accounts.notifier)?;
///        
///        // Release lock
///        ctx.accounts.vault.locked = false;
///        Ok(())
///    }
///    ```
/// 
/// ## Educational Purpose
/// 
/// This attacker program is intentionally simplified to demonstrate the CONCEPT
/// of reentrancy attacks. In a real attack:
/// - The attacker would parse victim account data to read balances
/// - The attacker would construct proper CPI instructions back to the victim
/// - The attacker would loop multiple times to maximize drainage
/// 
/// For this educational repository:
/// - The attack mechanics are documented in code comments
/// - The actual recursive CPI is demonstrated in TypeScript tests
/// - This program serves as the "external notifier" that proves control transfer

pub mod cpi_reentrancy_attacker {
    use super::*;

    /// ## Reentrancy Hook Function
    /// 
    /// This function is called by the victim program during a CPI.
    /// It represents the moment when the ATTACKER gains control of execution.
    /// 
    /// ### What Happens Here:
    /// 
    /// 1. **Control Transfer**: The victim program executed `invoke()` or `invoke_signed()`
    ///    to call this function, transferring control to the attacker.
    /// 
    /// 2. **State Inspection**: The attacker can now inspect the victim's accounts.
    ///    In a real attack, the attacker would:
    ///    ```rust
    ///    let vault_data = ctx.accounts.victim_vault.try_borrow_data()?;
    ///    let balance = u64::from_le_bytes(vault_data[8..16].try_into().unwrap());
    ///    msg!("Victim balance: {}", balance);  // Still shows OLD value!
    ///    ```
    /// 
    /// 3. **Reentrancy Decision**: The attacker determines if re-entry is possible.
    ///    Key questions:
    ///    - Is the victim vault balance still high? (Yes, it hasn't been updated yet)
    ///    - Is there a reentrancy guard? (Check for 'locked' flag)
    ///    - Can we construct a valid CPI back to the victim?
    /// 
    /// 4. **Recursive CPI Construction**: If vulnerable, the attacker would construct
    ///    a CPI back to the victim's `withdraw` function:
    ///    ```rust
    ///    // Pseudo-code for recursive CPI:
    ///    // let cpi_accounts = VictimWithdraw {
    ///    //     vault: ctx.accounts.victim_vault.clone(),
    ///    //     user: ctx.accounts.attacker_wallet.clone(),
    ///    //     notifier: ctx.program_id.clone(),  // Call ourselves again!
    ///    // };
    ///    // let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(ctx.accounts.victim_program.clone(), cpi_accounts);
    ///    // victim_program::cpi::unsafe_withdraw(cpi_ctx, DRAIN_AMOUNT)?;
    ///    ```
    /// 
    /// 5. **State Overwrite**: When control returns to the victim, the victim
    ///    will OVERWRITE the balance we just drained, using its stale `old_balance` value.
    /// 
    /// ### Why This Attack Works:
    /// 
    /// - Victim reads: `old_balance = 1000`
    /// - Victim calls us (we run this function)
    /// - We withdraw: `balance = 500` (updated on-chain)
    /// - Control returns to victim
    /// - Victim writes: `balance = old_balance - 100 = 900`
    /// - **We withdrew 600, but balance only decreased by 100!**
    /// 
    /// ### Why the Fix Works:
    /// 
    /// With CEI pattern + reentrancy guard:
    /// - Victim checks: `locked == false` ✓
    /// - Victim sets: `locked = true`
    /// - Victim updates: `balance = 900` (BEFORE calling us)
    /// - Victim calls us (we run this function)
    /// - If we try to re-enter: `locked == true` → **Transaction fails!**
    /// - Even if we bypass the lock somehow, balance is already 900 (not 1000)
    /// - Control returns to victim
    /// - Victim sets: `locked = false`
    /// 
    /// ### Educational Note:
    /// 
    /// This simplified implementation does NOT actually perform the recursive CPI.
    /// Instead, it:
    /// - Logs that control was transferred (proving the attack vector exists)
    /// - Documents HOW a real attacker would exploit this (in comments)
    /// - Serves as a placeholder for TypeScript tests to demonstrate the full attack
    /// 
    /// The actual recursive CPI construction is complex and would require:
    /// - Proper instruction data serialization
    /// - Account meta construction
    /// - Program ID resolution
    /// - Multiple iterations to maximize drainage
    /// 
    /// See `scripts/cpi-reentrancy.ts` for the full attack demonstration.

/// ## Reentrancy Hook Account Context
/// 
/// This struct defines the accounts that the attacker receives when the victim
/// calls this program via CPI.
/// 
/// ### Account Roles:
/// 
/// 1. **victim_vault**: The account the victim is trying to protect
///    - Contains balance and state data
///    - Attacker inspects this to determine if re-entry is profitable
///    - In a real attack, attacker would parse this account's data
/// 
/// 2. **victim_program**: The program ID of the vulnerable victim
///    - Used to construct recursive CPI calls back to the victim
///    - Allows attacker to invoke victim's functions during the CPI
///

///

/// - The attacker doesn't know the exact structure of victim's accounts

///

/// - It's not because we FORGOT to validate
/// - It's because we're INTENTIONALLY inspecting arbitrary victim accounts
