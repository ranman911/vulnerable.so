/// # Signer Privilege Escalation Attacker Program
/// 
/// This program demonstrates how to exploit missing signer identity validation.
/// It attempts to attack both the vulnerable and fixed versions to show:
/// - **Vulnerable version**: Attack succeeds (any signer can pause the protocol)
/// - **Fixed version**: Attack fails (has_one constraint enforces owner check)
///
/// ## Attack Strategy
///
/// The vulnerability exists because:
/// 1. The victim checks that SOMEONE signed (Signer type)
/// 2. But doesn't verify WHO signed (no identity check)
/// 3. No `has_one = owner` constraint linking signer to stored owner
/// 4. Assumes all signers have equal privileges (WRONG!)
///
/// The attacker exploits this by:
/// 1. Creating their own wallet and signing a transaction
/// 2. Calling the victim's privileged function (e.g., toggle_pause)
/// 3. Successfully executing admin-only operations despite not being the owner
/// 4. Gaining full control over protocol state
///
/// ## Expected Results
///
/// - **Against vulnerable version**: ✅ Attack succeeds, protocol paused by non-owner
/// - **Against fixed version**: ❌ Attack fails with "has_one constraint violated"
